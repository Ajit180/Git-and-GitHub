Question 2. Explain the Git Workflow, including the staging area, working directory, and repository.

Solutions:

Sure, here's a concise explanation of the Git workflow:

1. Working Directory: 
   - Your local copy of project files.
   - Where you make changes.

2. Staging Area (Index):
   - Intermediate space to prepare changes.
   - Use `git add` to stage changes.

3. Repository:
   - Permanent storage of project history.
   - Commits represent snapshots of the project.
   - Use `git commit` to save staged changes.

The workflow involves modifying files in the working directory, staging changes for commit in the staging area, and then committing those changes to the repository.
